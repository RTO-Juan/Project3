    <h1>Guide on the Basics of Playing Aatrox</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my guide on how to play Aatrox in the Top Lane.</p>
    <p>I have been playing League of Legends since 2020 and have played top this entire time.</p>
    <p>I'm not too proud of my rank but the highest I have reached is Emerald One -87 LP.</p>
    <p><img class="center-img" src="images/rank.png" alt="My sad sad rank"></p>
    <p>A quick intro to League of Legends: it's an online MOBA game launched in 2009, primarily played on PC. The game has over 50 million active monthly players worldwide.</p>
    <p>The game takes place in an arena called Summoner’s Rift. It has 5 distinct roles: Top, Jungle, Mid, Bot, and Support — each with its own responsibilities. We'll focus on the Top Lane.</p>

    <p>More specifically, we'll be focusing on the Champion Aatrox. Aatrox is classified in the Fighter class.</p>

    <p>The first thing you should know when playing Aatrox is which runes to take.</p>
    <p>Aatrox almost always uses the Precision tree as his primary and Resolve tree as his secondary.</p>
    <div class="runes">
      <div class="rune-column">
        <h3>Precision</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Conqueror</li>
          <li>Triumph</li>
          <li>Alacrity</li>
          <li>Last Stand</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="rune-column">
        <h3>Resolve</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Overgrowth</li>
          <li>Second Wind</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Your rune page should look like the following image:</p>
    <div class="rune-image">

    </div>
    <p>At the start of every League of Legends game, each player is given 500 gold to buy items. As a Top laner, your starting item is highly matchup-dependent.</p>
    <p>You can either buy Doran's Blade or Doran's Shield. Generally, Aatrox should always take Doran’s Blade because he is a fighter.</p>
    <p>With that, you now have a quick and simple guide on how to play Aatrox in the Top Lane.</p>
    <p>Good luck, and I’ll see you on the Rift!</p>
